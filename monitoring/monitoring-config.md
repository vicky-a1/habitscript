# InnerSparks MindBloom - Monitoring & Analytics Configuration

## 1. Sentry Error Tracking & Performance Monitoring

### Setup Instructions
1. Create a Sentry account at https://sentry.io
2. Create a new React project in Sentry
3. Copy the DSN from your project settings
4. Add to your environment variables:
   ```
   VITE_SENTRY_DSN=https://your-dsn@sentry.io/project-id
   VITE_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production
   ```

### Features Implemented
- ✅ Real-time error tracking with stack traces
- ✅ Performance monitoring for API calls
- ✅ User context tracking (role, ID, email)
- ✅ Custom breadcrumbs for user actions
- ✅ Error boundary with user-friendly fallbacks
- ✅ Filtered error reporting (excludes browser extensions, network errors)

### Key Metrics Tracked
- Journal analysis API performance
- Authentication events (login/logout)
- User session management
- Component rendering errors
- API failure rates and response times

## 2. Performance Monitoring Setup

### Core Web Vitals
Monitor these key performance indicators:
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: < 1.8s
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 2.5s
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: < 100ms
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.1

### API Performance Targets
- **Journal Analysis**: < 3s response time
- **Authentication**: < 500ms response time
- **Data Loading**: < 1s response time
- **Error Rate**: < 1% for critical operations

### Implementation
```javascript
// Already implemented in src/lib/sentry.ts
- monitorApiCall() wrapper for all API calls
- Performance transaction tracking
- Custom metrics for user engagement
```

## 3. Security Monitoring

### Authentication Security
- Failed login attempt tracking
- Session timeout monitoring
- Suspicious access pattern detection
- Teacher credential validation logging

### Data Protection
- Encrypted data transmission monitoring
- Sensitive data access logging
- GDPR compliance tracking
- Data retention policy enforcement

### Implementation Status
- ✅ Login/logout event tracking
- ✅ Session validation monitoring
- ✅ Error context without sensitive data
- ⏳ Advanced threat detection (recommended)

## 4. User Engagement Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Journal Entry Frequency**: Daily/weekly patterns
- **AI Mentor Usage**: Analysis requests and feedback
- **Feature Adoption**: Which features are most used
- **Session Duration**: Time spent in application
- **User Retention**: Return visit patterns

### Recommended Tools
1. **Google Analytics 4** (Privacy-focused)
2. **Mixpanel** (Event tracking)
3. **Hotjar** (User behavior)
4. **Custom Dashboard** (Internal metrics)

### Privacy Considerations
- Anonymized user tracking
- GDPR/CCPA compliance
- Opt-in analytics
- Data minimization principles

## 5. System Reliability Monitoring

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- **Server Uptime**: 99.9% target
- **Database Performance**: Query response times
- **CDN Performance**: Asset delivery speed
- **SSL Certificate**: Expiration monitoring

### Application Health Checks
```javascript
// Health check endpoints to implement:
GET /api/health - Basic health status
GET /api/health/detailed - Comprehensive system check
GET /api/health/dependencies - External service status
```

### Alerting Thresholds
- **Critical**: 5xx errors > 1% in 5 minutes
- **Warning**: Response time > 3s for 2 minutes
- **Info**: Unusual traffic patterns

## 6. Backup & Disaster Recovery Monitoring

### Backup Verification
- Daily backup completion checks
- Backup integrity validation
- Recovery time testing (monthly)
- Cross-region backup replication

### Disaster Recovery Metrics
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: < 4 hours
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: < 1 hour
- **Data Loss Prevention**: Zero tolerance
- **Service Restoration**: Automated where possible

## 7. Load Testing & Capacity Planning

### Load Testing Scenarios
1. **Normal Load**: 100 concurrent users
2. **Peak Load**: 500 concurrent users
3. **Stress Test**: 1000+ concurrent users
4. **Spike Test**: Sudden traffic increases

### Performance Benchmarks
- Journal analysis under load: < 5s
- Authentication under load: < 1s
- Database queries: < 100ms
- Memory usage: < 80% of available

### Tools Recommended
- **Artillery.js** for load testing
- **k6** for performance testing
- **New Relic** for APM
- **DataDog** for infrastructure monitoring

## 8. Compliance & Audit Monitoring

### GDPR/Privacy Compliance
- Data processing consent tracking
- Right to deletion request handling
- Data portability request monitoring
- Privacy policy acceptance tracking

### Security Audit Trail
- Administrative action logging
- Data access pattern monitoring
- Security configuration changes
- Incident response documentation

## 9. Real-time Dashboards

### Executive Dashboard
- System uptime percentage
- Active user count
- Error rate trends
- Performance metrics summary

### Technical Dashboard
- API response times
- Error breakdown by component
- Database performance metrics
- Security event timeline

### User Experience Dashboard
- User journey completion rates
- Feature usage statistics
- Support ticket trends
- User satisfaction scores

## 10. Alerting & Incident Response

### Alert Channels
- **Critical**: SMS + Email + Slack
- **Warning**: Email + Slack
- **Info**: Slack only

### Escalation Matrix
1. **Level 1**: Development team (immediate)
2. **Level 2**: Technical lead (15 minutes)
3. **Level 3**: Management (30 minutes)
4. **Level 4**: External support (1 hour)
